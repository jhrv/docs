NAIS documentation
==================

> This documentation contains several steps and links specific to developers at NAV. Some of them link to internal information in private repositories. If you're not a developer at NAV, you might want to head over to the [platform](/documentation/platform.md) and the NAIS [contracts](/README.md#contracts).

Documentation can be [read here](/documentation).
